# Xonix

This is really, really old terminal game implemented in Web.

This implementation was created around 2009 with one of the initial realease of
[Google Web Toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit), now known
an open source project [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/).

I haven't tried using GWT since original version 1, and can't say if this code could still
be compiled or updated for the recent versions. Moreover, with the abundance of JavaScript
toolkits, emergence strongly-typed languages such as `dart` or `typescript`, and
advance built-in debugging tools I am not sure writing everything in Java still makes sense.

Nevertheless, I preserve the implementation here in its original form. Fortunately, and to Google's creadit,
JavaScript files generated then still work today.
